## Aug 20: Colour Sliders with Javascript, CSS Variables and HSL

Join us for the last session of our pilot illusion series where we build a colour slider for our Tissue Contrast Illusion.

[RSVP on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pxandpints/events/272560931/) (optional)

In [Part 1 of this series](https://youtu.be/izoeGPX5vfA) we re-created the [Tissue Contrast Illusion](http://browsertherapy.com/challenges/tissue-contrast/) in the browser. It consisted of three overlapping layers:

1. Two identical grey circles
2. Under the circles: split-colour background
3. On top of the circles: semi-transparent image.

July 23rd, we extended our illusion with buttons that toggle (turn off/on) the split background and image to better illustrate this excellent illusion by Arthur Shapiro.
