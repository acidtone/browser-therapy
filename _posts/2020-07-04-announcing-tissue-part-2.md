## July 23: Toggling CSS Transitions with JS and `Element.classList`

[RSVP on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pxandpints/events/271657040/) (optional)

[Zoom thinger](https://zoom.us/j/96271146848)

In [Part 1 of this series](https://youtu.be/izoeGPX5vfA) we re-created the [Tissue Contrast Illusion](http://browsertherapy.com/challenges/tissue-contrast/) in the browser. It consisted of three overlapping layers:

1. Two identical grey circles
2. Under the circles: split-colour background
3. On top of the circles: semi-transparent image.

July 23rd, we extend our illusion with buttons that toggle (turn off/on) the split background and image to better illustrate this excellent illusion by Arthur Shapiro.
